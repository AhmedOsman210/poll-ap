# Polling App with Jexia Integration

This Node.js application provides a polling system where users can view polls, answer questions, and see real-time voting results. It interacts with a Jexia backend to store and retrieve poll data, questions, and answers.

## Features
- Poll creation and retrieval
- Question and answer management
- Real-time voting and result updates
- Jexia as a backend service for data storage

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A Jexia account and API credentials (API_KEY and API_SECRET)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polling-app.git
cd polling-app
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
You need to configure the necessary environment variables, including the API_KEY and API_SECRET for Jexia.

Create a .env file at the root of your project and add the following:

ini
Copy
Edit
API_KEY=your_jexia_api_key
API_SECRET=your_jexia_api_secret
Replace your_jexia_api_key and your_jexia_api_secret with the actual values from your Jexia project.

4. Run the App
After installing dependencies and configuring the environment variables, start the application with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
node app.js
The application will run on http://localhost:80 (or another port if configured).

Endpoints
The application exposes the following API endpoints:

GET /poll/:uuid
Retrieves a poll by its UUID. Returns a JSON object with poll details, including the poll's name, message, and associated questions and answers.

        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "answer": "Blue",

        }
      ]
    }

Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend server for handling API requests and interactions with Jexia.
Express.js: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
Jexia: Backend service for managing and storing poll, question, and answer data.
UUID: Used for uniquely identifying poll questions and answers.
CORS: Ensures that the application can interact with web clients from different domains.
Body-Parser: Parses incoming request bodies in JSON format.
Troubleshooting
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace'):
Ensure that the environment variables API_KEY and API_SECRET are set correctly.
Check that your Jexia project is configured properly and that the credentials are valid.
